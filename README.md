Dataset Card for Animal Ecology Drone Datasets

tl;dr - We present a drone metadata standard to make drone-based wildlife datasets FAIR, AI-ready, and compliant with Darwin Core biodiversity data standards.

**Contributions:** dataset card compliant with FAIR + Darwin and scripts demonstrating how this is implemented on 2 datasets

**Abstract:** Field data collection using aerial and underwater drones represents a substantial investment of time, expertise, and financial resources. Yet most existing datasets serve only a single research community, limiting interdisciplinary reuse. We propose a unified FAIR^2 Drone Data Standard that bridges ecology, robotics, and computer vision by building on existing frameworks while adding essential platform metadata and annotation specifications. Our standard enables datasets to simultaneously support ecological analysis, robotics algorithm development, and computer vision benchmarking. We provide open-source validation tools, reference implementations, and multimodal extensions linking drone imagery with complementary sensors such as camera traps, GPS, and acoustics. By standardizing metadata across disciplines, this framework maximizes the scientific return on investment for costly field deployments and accelerates cross-domain collaboration in environmental monitoring.
