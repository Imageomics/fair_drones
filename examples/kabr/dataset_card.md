## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale

This dataset was created to address two key research questions:

1. **What drone flight parameters optimize behavioral data quality?** By correlating altitude, speed, distance, and camera settings with annotation completeness and animal visibility, researchers can develop evidence-based protocols for wildlife monitoring.

2. **Can we quantify animal disturbance from drone presence?** Frame-level behavior annotations allow detection of alert, fleeing, or disrupted behaviors that indicate drone impact.

The dataset fills a critical gap: while many drone wildlife datasets provide detection boxes, few include detailed behavior labels synchronized with flight telemetry. This enables research on the trade-offs between data quality and animal welfare.

### Source Data

#### Data Collection and Processing

**Field Collection:**

1. **Planning:**
   - Sites selected based on known zebra and giraffe populations at Mpala Research Centre
   - Flights conducted during peak activity hours (morning/afternoon)
   - Safety briefings and airspace clearance for each flight

2. **Collection:**
   - Operators located focal groups via binoculars or vehicle sighting
   - Drones launched 50-100m from animals
   - Continuous video recording while following group movements
   - Flight logs automatically recorded in SRT files
   - Field notes on weather, behavior, and technical issues

3. **Post-Processing:**
   - Videos transferred from SD cards with immediate backup
   - SRT files extracted for telemetry data
   - Frame extraction at 1 fps in CVAT annotation platform
   - Detection bounding boxes drawn for all visible animals
   - Mini-scenes identified (continuous behavioral sequences)
   - Behavior labels applied by trained ecologists
   - Quality review of all annotations

**Software and Tools Used:**
- Flight planning: DJI Fly app
- Video capture: DJI Mavic Air 2 / DJI Mini onboard recording
- Frame extraction: CVAT (Computer Vision Annotation Tool)
- Annotation: CVAT with custom behavior taxonomy
- Telemetry parsing: Custom Python scripts
- Data merging: `merge_behavior_telemetry.py` (this repository)

### Annotations

#### Annotation Process

**🤖 Annotation Method:**
- [x] Semi-automated (CVAT tracking tools + manual review and behavior labeling)

**Tools Used:**
- Software: CVAT (Computer Vision Annotation Tool)
- Version: Web-based platform (2023)

**Annotation Guidelines:**
- All visible animals annotated with bounding boxes
- Bounding boxes drawn tightly around animal body
- Partial occlusions included if >30% of animal visible
- Track IDs maintained across frames within mini-scenes
- Behavior labels applied based on dominant activity in frame
- Uncertain behaviors marked for expert review

**Quality Control:**
- Training included intensive review of species-specific behavioral definitions with video examples, technical instruction on the CVAT interface, and practice annotation sessions until achieving greater than 90\% agreement with expert annotations
- Weekly calibration sessions throughout the annotation period to address interpretation drift and maintain consistency across all annotators. These included random double-annotation of 10\% of mini-scenes to monitor inter-annotator reliability (achieving $\kappa=0.88$ for primary behavioral categories), weekly calibration sessions to address any annotation drift, and final expert review by field-experienced team members for all completed annotations. 

**Annotation Coverage:**
- Fully annotated: No (not all frames have animals)
- Frames with visible animals: ~90% annotated
- Behavior labels: Applied to mini-scenes (continuous sequences)
- Missing annotations: Frames without animals or poor quality (blur, occlusion)

#### Who are the annotators?

**Annotator Team:**
- Number of annotators: 10, including expert reviewers
- Expertise: Research staff, professors, and students in ecology/computer science with wildlife identification training
- Training provided: 2 hours initial training + ongoing feedback
- Compensation: Academic credit and authorship

| *Giraffa reticulata* | Reticulated giraffe | 6 | 2 | 4-8 |
| Mixed | Multiple species | 6 | 1 | 2-4 |

**Class Balance:**
- Plains zebra over-represented (opportunistic sampling)
- Grevy's zebra limited by lower population density
- Giraffes limited to specific habitat types

**Video Characteristics:**
- Frame count range: 10,000-66,000 frames per video
- Duration range: 3-50 minutes per video
- Altitude range: 8-72 m above sea level
- Typical animal size in frame: 50-200 pixels (height)

**Behavior Distribution:**
- Walking: ~40%
- Grazing: ~25%
- Standing/vigilance: ~20%
- Running: ~10%
- Other (social, nursing, etc.): ~5%

### Bias, Risks, and Limitations

**⚠️ Known Biases:**

1. **Geographic Bias:**
   - Data from single site (Mpala Research Centre, Laikipia)
   - May not generalize to other savanna ecosystems
   - Represents dry season only, captured during drought conditions

2. **Temporal Bias:**
   - Morning and afternoon flights only (battery/weather constraints)
   - Nocturnal or dawn/dusk behavior not captured
   - Single month snapshot (seasonal variation not represented)

3. **Species Bias:**
   - Plains zebra over-represented (most abundant species)
   - Grevy's zebra limited by population size
   - No data on smaller species (<50 cm body size)

4. **Environmental Bias:**
   - Dry season habitat conditions
   - Drought-affected vegetation
   - Clear to partly cloudy weather only
   - No wet season or dense vegetation scenarios

5. **Detection Bias:**
   - Animals in open areas more likely to be followed
   - Dense vegetation reduces detection probability
   - Cryptic species under-represented

**Technical Limitations:**

- **Image Quality:** Variable due to altitude, lighting, and atmospheric conditions
- **Coverage Gaps:** 11 videos lack occurrence data due to missing/corrupted SRT files or failed processing
- **Annotation Limitations:** Behavior labels are subjective; inter-observer agreement not quantified
- **GPS Accuracy:** ±5-10m typical; may drift during long flights

**Ethical Limitations:**

- **Animal Welfare:** Potential for disturbance despite mitigation efforts
- **Data Usage:** GPS coordinates could theoretically enable harmful uses (though species are common and well-protected at Mpala)

### Recommendations

**Best Practices for Using This Dataset:**

1. **For Detection/Tracking Models:**
   - Account for altitude-dependent scale variation (20-50m range)
   - Consider species-specific detection difficulty (giraffes easier than zebras)
   - Test generalization to new sites (single-location training data)

2. **For Behavior Recognition:**
   - Class imbalance exists; consider weighted loss or resampling
   - Behavior labels are coarse; fine-grained states may be ambiguous
   - Temporal context improves accuracy (behaviors occur in sequences)

3. **For Ecological Analysis:**
   - Do not extrapolate to wet season without additional data
   - Account for detection probability varying by habitat/altitude
   - Animal counts are minimum estimates (some individuals may be hidden)

4. **For Drone Protocol Development:**
   - Correlate altitude/speed with detection rate and annotation completeness
   - Monitor for behavioral responses in data (alert, flee behaviors)
   - Consider trade-offs between data quality and disturbance risk

**Ethical Use:**

- Do not use for unethical wildlife targeting or harassment
- Respect that full GPS coordinates enable site replication for conservation research
- Cite dataset appropriately and acknowledge indigenous land stewardship

**What This Dataset Should NOT Be Used For:**

- Estimating absolute population sizes (sampling is not systematic)
- Generalizing to wet season, nighttime, or other habitats/regions
